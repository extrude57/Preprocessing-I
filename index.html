      I have time to work on any project in need. I can collaborate, engineer, and develop any sourced and coded projects. Contact me for
      enquories or any career opurtunitys. I've worked in game engineering and I am very well known in the industry for working on
      such titles as medal of honor, doom2, GTA1-4. In 1987 I worked on Nintindo games and helped to build Mario Bros., Castlevainia, and 
      many other well known Nintindo titles. I worked on genises games after Nintindo started losing sales and we started programming games
      in 3d with the MAX 3G unit. Through 1991 & 1997 I worked on such titles as Skitchen, Tazmanian Devil, Mortal Combat, Worms, and Mario
      cart 3D. Between my extensive game design experience and my web development skills if there is any app you have in mind, I will write
      out a EFFC Agreement that you will docusign and we will stay in contact as extensive business partners to achieve the app in mind for 
      your company.
